# Mt Cook region

Mt Cook region is honestly the country’s most beautiful place! Even though I have only one Mountain route as a suggestion there is plenty of multi pitch climbing there, and nice single day or multi day routes we can do.

We have access to the Alpine lodge there (with showers, power, kitchen, fridge etc) for accommodation.

## Mt Annette via Sebastapol ridge
#### Grade 2
#### Estimated time: 8-11 Hours

A scenic and accessible alpine outing near Aoraki/Mt Cook Village, this route follows the broad Sebastopol Ridge up to Mt Annette. The ridge offers steady elevation gain with increasingly expansive views over the Hooker Valley, Mueller Glacier, and the Southern Alps. The final approach to the summit of Mt Annette involves some easy scrambling and travel over rocky terrain, making it a rewarding choice for those looking for a moderate alpine experience with stunning panoramas.

## Nun’s Veil
#### Grade 2
#### Estimated time: 2 day mission
#### Notes: Logisitics means we need to pay (with a box of beers) for a boat ride across the tasman lake to get to the climb start (or swim...)

A striking climb in the Tasman Valley, Nun’s Veil rises sharply above the surrounding terrain and offers a remote, rewarding alpine experience. The approach via Gorilla Stream leads through a rugged glacial valley, gradually gaining height toward the prominent east ridge. From there, the route follows snow slopes and rocky ridgelines to the summit, with dramatic views over the Tasman Glacier, Aoraki/Mt Cook, and surrounding peaks. A true gem for those seeking solitude, scenery, and a classic alpine ascent.

## Mt Wakefield (Guideless Buttress)
#### Grade 3
#### Estimated time: ~10 Hours

This is a trip for fit climbers looking for a challenge, and one of the most spectacular lines in the Park. We like to think of the Guideless Route as Mount Cook's answer to the Remarkables Traverse!

The rock buttresses on Mount Wakefield offer some of the best views in Aoraki Mount Cook National Park. The route delivers excellent rock, mixed with scrambling, climbing gendarmes, and numerous buttresses, with plenty of exposure.
