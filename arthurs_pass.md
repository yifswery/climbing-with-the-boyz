## Arthur's Pass

Athers pass is about a 1hr 30mm drive from my house, this means we can easily drive there and back for single day trips out in the hills. Additionally we will have access to the Alpine Lodge (full lodge with Showers and kitchen) if we wanted to not do the driving and do back to back moutains in the valley

Arthers pass is known for fairly predictable weather but loose choss rock. The following routes are all single day trips (full days) and are fairly technical (dont need to do multi day appraoch hikes to get to the routes)
